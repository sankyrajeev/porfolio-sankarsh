                    I am a Full Stack Developer with a background in Electronics and Communication.I pursued my an MFA degree from California Institute of Arts and graduated in 2022.
                    I also completed a Music Production Certification from Icon Collective, Los Angeles. I took a small web design course from Udemy and decided that this is something i enjoy doing a lot.
                    I was able to join the UCLA Extension program which develop skills with various web technologies. Over the course of six months i have learnt a lot of technologies and some of them are listed below:
