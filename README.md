# porfolio-sankarsh 

## Description 

This is a Portfolio built using REACT and some vanilla javascript and CSS. Through this project i was able to learn how REACT operates and how easy it is compared to regular Web Development. SOme of the challenges i had included embeding images and overwritng bootstrap commands. I learnt how to input multiple data using Javacsript compared to the old HTML which was harder.
